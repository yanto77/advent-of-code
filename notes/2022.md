Data:
    Only singles        1-1,1-1
    One double          1-10,1-1
                        1-1,1-10
    Two doubles         10-10,1-1
                        1-10,1-10
                        1-1,10-10
    Three doubles       10-10,1-10
                        1-10,10-10
    Four doubles        10-10,10-10

## 06,

current solution uses double loop, but it's also possible to do substr-validation
with single loop and hashmap-like thing. however, interestingly, those approaches
are slower. unordered_set probably uses dynamic memory and maybe some semi-complex
hash, so it's immediately out of the question. the array method is quite simple,
but maybe because there's some little but extra memory management, it's slightly worse
than doing two loops?

    double-loop:        ~3.6 us
    array-lookup:       ~4.2 us
    unoredered_set:   ~700.0 us

forgot the same thing i forgot last time as well -- std::array<bool, 32> is 8x 
larger than uint32_t. using uint32 for the lookup beats double-for-loop clearly.

    uint32-lookup:      ~2.8 us

the old code is preserved in history, but otherwise it's removed from the final
solution.


## 07

experiment with 

    struct dir_t { uint64_t node; uint64_t parent; size_t size; };

or maybe even (there's only 159 dirs)

    struct dir_t { uint32_t node; uint8_t parent_idx; size_t size; };

## 09

with std::set:                  ~3000 us
with hardcoded array<bool>:      ~500 us
with packed bits in uint64_t:    ~700 us
