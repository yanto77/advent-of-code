Data:
    Only singles        1-1,1-1
    One double          1-10,1-1
                        1-1,1-10
    Two doubles         10-10,1-1
                        1-10,1-10
                        1-1,10-10
    Three doubles       10-10,1-10
                        1-10,10-10
    Four doubles        10-10,10-10

## 06,

current solution uses double loop, but it's also possible to do substr-validation
with single loop and hashmap-like thing. however, interestingly, those approaches
are slower. unordered_set probably uses dynamic memory and maybe some semi-complex
hash, so it's immediately out of the question. the array method is quite simple,
but maybe because there's some little but extra memory management, it's slightly worse
than doing two loops?

    double-loop:        ~3.6 us
    array-lookup:       ~4.2 us
    unoredered_set:   ~700.0 us
