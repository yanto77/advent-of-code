`is_valid()` seems like a good candidate for vector instructions.

=> base case: 14000 us

we can return early, and not need to calculate pt2 counters.

=> early return case: 4900 us


uint8_t     -> 8 bits
    6 chars => 48 bits

64 bit stuff is MMX
128 bit is SSE(2)
256 bit is AVX(2)


bit:                  1 bit
byte:                 8 bits
word:       2 bytes, 16 bits
doubleword: 4 bytes, 32 bits
quadword:   8 bytes, 64 bits

TODO:
* how all the instrinsic headers differ? e.g <immintrin.h> vs <mmintrin.h> vs others?
