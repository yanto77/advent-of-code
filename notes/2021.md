## day01

* try combining both with single 4-int window.
* try processing data inline, without parsing it to a vector<int> first.

## day04

* try expect/accept parsing way

## day05

* probably better solution:
    array<int8_t> = [[]]
    for all lines:
        +1 for all points that are on the line

    for all cells:
        count all that have >=2 values

## day06

- buckets instead of simulating each and every fish
- parsing input with custom rules and assumptions that format is (N,N,N,...)
- instead of shifting the buckets, shift the indexes ??
    - something like `B[(7 + i) % 9] += B[i % 9]`. cannot wrap my head around those indexes.
